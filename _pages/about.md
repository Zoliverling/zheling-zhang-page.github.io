## VV-Couplet: An open source Chinese couplet generation system
  Brief Introduction: In this research, I helped to developing the VV-Couplet system, which is an open-source project for generating Chinese couplets. It's based on an attention-based sequence-to-sequence neural model, ensuring adherence to the specific rules of Chinese couplets. My focus was on enhancing rule learning through a local attention mechanism, offering a unique approach to preserving this cultural heritage.

  Contribution: In the final stage of the VV-Couplet project, my contribution focused on refining and validating the system's performance which mainly involved testing the model's ability to adhere to the complex rules of Chinese couplets, ensuring it generated high-quality, rule-compliant second lines from given first lines. I also worked on optimizing the local attention mechanism to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, I was involved in preparing the system for open-source release, ensuring that the documentation and code were accessible and user-friendly for future research and public use.

## Map and Relabel: Towards Almost-Zero Resource Speech Recognition
  Brief Introduction: In this study, we introduce a new method for speech recognition in resource-poor languages. In order to build a more sophisticated tri-phone system, we begin with a basic monophone deep neural network and then refine it using a combination of transfer and semi-supervised learning. With a small dataset of only 500 labeled utterances, we was able to demonstrate the efficacy of this method using the Uyghur language, emphasizing its potential to overcome low-resource language voice recognition difficulties.

  Contribution: In the early stage of our study, I focused on gathering audio data from questionnaires and various sources, laying the groundwork for our project. After completing this crucial data collection phase, I utilized Linux to meticulously filter and clean the data, ensuring we had the necessary inputs for our model. In the final stage, my efforts shifted to integrating all study materials and contributing significantly to the final output of the paper, ensuring a comprehensive and cohesive presentation of our findings.



# Selected Experience

## Internship
  From September to November 2020, I worked as an intern in the Technology Department at DIB Assessment Management in Beijing, China. I performed in-depth research and gathered financial data for a variety of industry sectors, including new energy vehicles and medicine. In order to help investors make decisions, I provided thorough financial reports that assessed the performance of the targeted investment funds. In addition, I wrote analytical papers and assembled data on Elon Musk and Tesla, which helped the new energy car sector tremendously.

## Project
  ### Image-based Kidney Tumor Prediction
    Brief Introduction: During my undergraduate studies, I used scikit-learn in Jupyter Notebooks to create three advanced models for image-based kidney tumor prediction. These models made use of cutting-edge methods such as Contracting-Expanding segmentation architectures, Squeeze-and-Excite, and Deep Supervision. I trained and validated these models using visual data from CT scans of kidney tumors, which greatly improved their accuracy.
